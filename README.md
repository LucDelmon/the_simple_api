# the_simple_api

## version: 0.1.0

### Introduction
The goal of this project is to create the simpliest API possible. But add on top the most complex and complete CI/CD pipeline. Try to apply best practices and add everything that a serious project shoud have. To be used as a reference.

Before version 1 I allow myself to rewrite the commit history to make it cleaner.
